# Arcade-Titlescreen
</br>
This is the code used for the handeye society's curious cabinets exhibit </br>
It was done quickly and has lots of commented out sections as we switched drivers/ideas to make it happen </br>
Please enjoy and make better!</br></br>
The titlescreen was written in Processing and needs the sound files (placed in the root folder) and data folder to run properly</br></br>
There were 2 cabinets at the exhibit (SpriteBox & One Button Torontron) and although both codes are similar they are attached separately, let's make them one!</br>
Please enjoy and make better!</br></br>
